# FINAL PROJECT
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/GvZwEO6u-I0
#### Description: My CS50P Final Project was to focus on a program that I could use personally. I have (ahem) put on the "freshman 15" since becoming a coder, and so I made a weight loss calculator to help me calculate how many pounds I can lose by any given date.

### Deciding on what to make for the final project was an easy decision. I feel I learned many practical skills during this courses lecture and many homework assignments, and once given the chance to program something for myself, I knew exactly what to do. Because of the always limited amount of time I had to create this program, I knew to keep it simple. I made 3 additional functions inside the main function. I also unit tested the 3 functions using Pytest. All functions pass.

### I noticed during the class that a seemingly simple homework could end up longer than expected when a small typo or error was created but not recognized. I know in the real world, deadlines matter. This is and always will be an important part of setting goals when developing. I also know that it's important to start my code with simple abstract functions and build from there, testing as I go along to catch small errors (especially typos or incorrect data type calls). It is more important to have a simple working program that can be added to later, than a complex program that doesn't meet the deadline. I feel I learned a great deal of how to compose programs from this particular course, perhaps because Prof. Malan taught the language starting from its most basic elements and distilled each lesson down to the minimum elements to impart to his students, before building into more complex functionality.

### I do think that for next steps, I thought of several iterations that could add additional functionality. I would add to future iterations the ability to modify the weight loss calculator with how many workouts and how many calories burned per workout being an input made by the user, with a default of the numbers I used in the calculator. Alternatively, I could add the user input variable for daily calories consumed, assuming I don't want to cut out all fun food from my diet.

### I did find the actual project very helpful in learning how rewarding it is to program for yourself occasionally. It really made all of the difference in creative inspiration for a project. I daresay, I will explore writing personal programs when trying out future coding endeavors. I did have a very hard time for this course writing the unit tests. However, I found them useful in understanding my own codes mistakes, and they are a valuable tool to use alongside a debugger. Type hints were taught and noticed, but I have experience in C, so I feel I'm a little more aware of data types because of the nature of C language programming.

### I enjoyed test the weight loss calcultor with different days. It has inspired me to eat healthier even as I write this. I also thought about adding some constant for calories of snacks and meals, so that I could creat a sample meal plan. However, I know how quickly the code can get overly complicated, so I would have to keep it simple for the final project. It's not to say that I won't try to add it later, especially since we have similar features from functions inside the homeworks on order pizza, or tabulating totals from grocery shopping list homework. I love that fucntions and libraries can be reused in Python. It makes it tempting to build and develop. It is my new favorite language.

### I did my best to adhere to all of the standards on the final project. I am psychologically dependent on the check50 feature that we can access for each homework. I consider it a final approval even after testing my own code. Sometimes, I found that my code worked when I tested it, but the cs50 check had more edge cases than I thought to include. I know this instinct will develop with experience and failed execution during future developement. I'm sure the rigorous unit testing assignments are meant to address this problem, as there won't be a CS50 checker in the real world.

### Thank you for checking out my Final Project for your dedication to CS50!
